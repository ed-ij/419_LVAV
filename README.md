The Advancing Out-of-School Learning in Mathematics and Engineering (AOLME) project is an interdisciplinary effort from faculty with areas of expertise in bilingual education, mathematics education, and electrical and computer engineering.

AOLME has determined that their current manual method of analyzing video recordings of classroom interaction is very time consuming and inefficient. In order to address this inefficiency, AOLME has approved a project called â€œLarge-scale Video Annotation and Visualization (LVAV).

The LVAV project will consist of developing a software product to automate video annotation of student engagement activities (reading, writing, talking).
