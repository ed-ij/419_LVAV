# Project Title

This Large-scale Video Annotation and Visualization (LVAV) project was commissioned to fullfill a need for an open accessible platform for flexible & manual annotation of large quantities of video footage. The specific use case being designed for is video deep learning but we are aware that there are potentially far more applications. 

The main objectives of the active LVAV project currently consist of developing a web app to speed up video annotation of student engagement activities (reading, writing, talking).

This project was initiated and sponsored by the [Advancing Out-of-School Learning in Mathematics and Engineering (AOLME) project](https://aolme.unm.edu/).

A demo site is under contruction and will be availible [here] soon!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

1) Get a text editor, we recommend using [Atom](https://atom.io/) for a nice code editing experience from 
2) Install a Git revision control system, we like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for it's full GitHub compatibility and ease of use
3) A modern browser for testing (Chrome 72 recommended, go to chrome://settings/help on chrome to find out the version you are using)
4) Some features have to be tested remotely as for security reasons they cannot be tested locally, if think you may need to do this check out the "Setup for Testing Server Functionality" section

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the git repository

```
https://github.com/edward-ij/419_LsVAV.git
```

Setup a .gitconfig file by replacing the capitalized sections and placing it in your main user area

```
[user]
        name = <NAME>
        email = <EMAIL>
```

Setup the .gitignore file

```
will include files that contain sensitive info that should not end up on GitHub
```

From a file browser double-click the `Release/annotate_noServer.html` to run the file

### Coding Style info

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Under development...(Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system)

## Built With

* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - The database platform and API used
* [jQuery File Tree](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-file-tree) - Used to generate the server file tree

## Contributing

Under development...(Please read [LinkText](linkURL) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

## Versioning

We kinda made this up to start with as we were unsure as to how many development stages we would go through, we will use a better system once we hit v 0.1.0.0
